This project is an online-community framework application. It provides a site where an inspired group of individuals can create, manage, and drive their agenda, whether a grassroots initiative, a club or any other group-driven initiative. It has a calendar for scheduling events, a member contact list and a bulletin board for posting upcoming volunteer activities. 

One Administrator has sole authority for maintaining the application, and Users can sign up and log on with designated passwords. All data is stored in a MySQL database and the code is javascript-based with handlebars in a express-node.js framework that utilizes sequelize and get/post routes for data communication with the database. Passport.js is used to link Users to the site via their favorite social media
accounts, e.g. facebook, linkedin, google.
