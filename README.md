# groupsapp

This project is an online community framework application. It offers a calendar for scheduling events, a member contact list and a bulletin board 
for posting upcoming volunteer activities. 

There is an Administrator role for managing the application, and Users can sign up, and logon with designated passwords. All data is stored in 
a MySQL database and the code is in javascript, handlebars, and sequelize. Passport.js is used to link Users to the site via their social media
accounts, e.g. facebook, linkedin, google.
